## Overview

Welcome to eBPF-MojitOS, a GitHub organization created as part of our university coursework. Our primary goal is to consolidate all our research and projects related to the development and application of eBPF technology. This initiative is specifically aimed at integrating these advancements into [MOJITO/S](https://gitlab.irit.fr/sepia-pub/mojitos), an Open Source System for Energy and Network Monitoring at the Operating System level. This project is being carried out in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT).

## Why eBPF?

eBPF is a technology that enables dynamic tracing and monitoring of systems without needing to change kernel source code or load kernel modules. Its application in MojitOS is expected to enhance the system's capabilities in terms of performance monitoring and security features.
